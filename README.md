# Bulk RNA seq analysis using a human pan-transcriptomic approach
I used a pan-transcriptomic approach to map bulk-RNA seq, using the vg tool, to improve the  accuracy of gene expression predictions.

# Pipeline
# Obtaining the human pantrasncriptome
# Mapping 
# Obtaing the expression 
# Bash scripts 
# Obtaining the gene level counts 
# Differential expression genes
